Instructions:

1-Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.
  I intend to show you the three Buildings which you can find me in campus 

2- I could use piping operator to facilitate the coding but
   I prefered to use the usual commands for more clarification .
   
3- Each marker involves the name of the corresponding place which by clicking on the name 
   the web address of the place would be appeared .
   
   
   
# The Map: (Check out the Campus!)   

```{r ,warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)

UICsites<-c(
    
    "<a href='https://library.uic.edu/libraries/daley'>UIC Library-Richard J.Daley Library</a>",
    "<a href='http://studentcenters.uic.edu/'>student center East (SCE)</a>",
    "<a href='https://www.uic.edu/'>Engineering Research Facility (ERF)</a>"
)

df <- data.frame(lat = c(41.872063,41.871796,41.869626),lng = c(-87.650046,-87.647119,-87.648903))
my_map <-leaflet(df) 
my_map<-addTiles(my_map)
my_map<-addMarkers(my_map, popup=UICsites)
my_map
```
